Log onto console.

Run `sudo raspi-config`

* Enable SSH
* Set Localizations: language, timezone, keyboard?
* Expand filesystem <<< Only do this after the whole raspberry pi is set up as you want it to be. Do a backup (dd if=... of=backupname.img) before you expand the filesystem.
   It may not need to be expanded at all.
* For headless server, reduce GPU RAM (64--> 16)

Reboot

If GUI, remove unwanted software now using "Preferences / Recommended Software" tool. (Removing it now prevents wasting time updating it and then removing it)

Then run "run_install_part1" and "run_install_part2" with the appropriate parts commented out.

Copy over all of the needed files (scripts, bin, crontabs) from superuser in old RPi to this superuser.
