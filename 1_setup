Log onto console.

Run `sudo raspi-config`

Enable SSH
Set Localizations: language, timezone, keyboard?
Expand filesystem <<< Only do this after the whole raspberry pi is set up as you want it to be. Do a backup (dd if=... of=backupname.img) before you expand the filesystem.
   It may not need to be expanded at all.

For headless server, reduce GPU RAM (64--> 16)

Reboot

Then run "run_install" with the appropriate parts commented out
and then copy over all of the needed files from superuser in old RPi to this superuser.
