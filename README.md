# RaspberryPI_installs
Install scripts for my Raspberry Pis.

There are a lot of useful scripts here, in particular, how to create a new sudo user to replace the default 'pi'.  Which scripts you want to use depends on what your RPi is bing used for. A headless server (running the lite version of the OS) is quite different from a GUI based machine.

1Ô∏è‚É£ First follow the steps in 1_setup

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then run "run_install_part1"  This will run various system config changes and then create a new superuser.

3Ô∏è‚É£ After that, you need to log  off and on again as the NEW user that you've just created. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Now, after running various commands to make sure that the new user works, the scripts will delete user 'pi'. It will continue by installing user specific changes.

## üí• Problems: 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The SSH update can lock you out of your computer    
‚ñ∂Ô∏è GUI vs Server makes a difference. There are extra things I want to configure on a GUI based system.
